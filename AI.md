(***) [Machine Learning course at Coursera](coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng.  
A required course for any people who are interested in machine learning.

(***) [Blog posts by Adam Geitgey](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471), his code examples (tensorflow + jupyter) are amazing ([GitHub link](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples)).  
Step by step introduction to machine learning using tensorflow.

(*) [Track deep learning related papers on Arxiv](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/)

(**) [nice blog posts from a stanford graduate Andrej Karpathy](http://karpathy.github.io/).  
A few excellent posts to introduce deep learning from a software engineer perspective.
